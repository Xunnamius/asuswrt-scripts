# My AsusWRT-Merlin addon

This addon adds easier configuration for most of the [scripts](/scripts) to the router's web UI.  
It will also automatically download required scripts.

### **Untested code alert!**

This was written before purchasing the router, it turned out that the model I bought is not supported by the Merlin firmware.
I didn't want this code to go to waste so I just commited it here, maybe it will be of use to someone... or my router gets Merlin support.

## Installation

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacklul/asuswrt-scripts/master/Merlin/JL.sh" -o /tmp/JL.sh && /bin/sh /tmp/JL.sh install
```
